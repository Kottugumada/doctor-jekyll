# Doctor Jekyll - Documentation template

Doctor Jekyll is a fork of [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme, built specifically for publishing documentation. 

You can get started in minutes and get your docs hosted on Github using Github Pages in no time. Doctor Jekyll also has built in documentation search powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)

## Super quick start

- Fork [Doctor Jekyll](https://github.com/bakery/doctor-jekyll). Clone your fork
- Add documentation for your project inside **docs** directory
- Adjust table of contents in **_data/table_of_contents.yaml**
- Update application settings in **_config.yml**
- Set up your Travis CI and include **ALGOLIA_API_KEY** env variable
- git push
- Profit!
